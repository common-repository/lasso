ToneDen Shortcode
==========================

Shortcode for WordPress that embeds ToneDen into a post.

Development
===
We should conform to the restrictions listed [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/), and the readme.txt conventions [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt).

Setup
---
Check out [this github repo](https://github.com/kasparsd/wp-deploy) to see where this comes from.
Since WordPress uses SVN instead of git, we have to set up parallel git and SVN repositories.
